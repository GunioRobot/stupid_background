Version 0.1.2 (11th February 2008)
- Added the 'user_runner :some_name' to the workers
  With this 'flag' it is possible to assign multiple workers to different runner
  so that they can run concurrently. Of course this increases your memory 
  footprint a lot, because every runner loads a full Rails environment, but
  it's an easy solution and work guaranteed, no threading etc ;)
  If two workers use the same 'runner name' then they are running on the same
  runner. So it's simple to group the workers into a few runner. Maybe a 
  ':long_running_runner' and a ':fast_runner' or so. 
- Also added a first spec! WOOOOAH! :) It's just a start and very... crappy but
  it's some kind of unit test and it's definitely the way to go and better than
  no test at all.

Version 0.1.1 (17th January 2008)
- Initial Release
- The first 'public' release of StupidBackground
- There is/was a 0.1.0 release but i got something wrong in the repository, so
  the first version is 0.1.1 instead ;)
